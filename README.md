# Chatbot-NLP
Design and Development of a Chatbot to be used in a Living Room

<br/>In this notebook, we will showcase the main functions of our Chatbot, with the ability to: inform the user about the weather, 
<br/>recommend songs using Spotify, fetch items from the kitchen,  and use Google Gemini for questions that are out of the Chatbotâ€™s capabilities. 
<br/>In addition, our Chatbot can hold simple conversations such as greeting, saying goodbye, and saying its name and age.

<br/>In this folder is the <b>Chatbot.ipynb file</b>.

<br/>We have uploaded our Intent Recogniser Neural Network Model into the repository:

Keras_model.keras

We have 3 pre-processed csv files, which include:

1. train_df.csv
2. test_df.csv
3. val_df.csv

<br/>This notebook was done together with my fellow group member Oh Sheng Han - for our Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence module of MA 4891 in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
